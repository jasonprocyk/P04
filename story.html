					<h1>I took a few <a href="#" data-chunk="humanities">different paths</a> to become an Interaction Researcher</h1>
					
					<p class="big">As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a paleontologist. Wait...So my five-year-old self hadn't quite figured it out yet. That's okay. I have been <a href="#" data-chunk="tinkering">making things with computers</a> for a while. I began to <a href="#" data-chunk="design">discover design</a> as a discipline much later, and I dove into the wonderful world of <a href="#" data-chunk="research">qualitative</a> research a short time after that.</p>
		
									
					<div class="story_branch" id="tinkering">
						<h2 class="story">Digital Tinkering</h2>
						<p>I love to make, model, simulate, iterate, evaluate, and remake. I learned (or rather "started learning") at a young age to recruit computers in this cause. Even away from work and away from school, I consider myself a digital tinkerer.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="story_branch" id="humanities">
						<h2 class="story">A Different Direction</h2>
						<p>There was a time where I put down technology to see what I could find in literature and philosophy. I completed a Bachelor of Arts in Humanities, and managed to spend a semester <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/FjCPy" title="See where I stayed" target="_blank">in Greece</a> along the way.</p>
						<p>I value the cross experience, and I feel it is especially useful for <a href="heartlocker.html"  title="Portfolio: Heart Locker">more conceptual projects</a> and design fictions. I learned to engage with ideas at a high level and to draw on the wisdom of great thinkers.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="story_branch" id="design">
						<h2 class="story">Discovering Design</h2>
						<p>I went to the <a href="http://siat.sfu.ca" title="Learn more about SIAT" target="_blank">School of Interactive Arts and Technology</a> at SFU to learn design as a discipline. I learned and practiced  user-centered design methods, and I began to focus on interactive systems and web technologies.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="story_branch" id="research">
						<h2 class="story">Diving Into Research</h2>
						<p>In the summer before the final year of my undergraduate studies, I earned a grant from <a href="http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/index_eng.asp" target="_blank" title="Learn about NSERC">NSERC</a> to do interaction design research for one of my professors. It started simply as a curiosity&mdash;something new and unusual but also more focused and more challenging&mdash;and turned into much more.</p>
						<p>That summer project yielded a year-long investigation into <a href="gems.html" title="Portfolio: GEMS">location-based storytelling</a> that produced a fully functional web application, a pair of conference paper submissions (with a trip to <a href="http://chi2013.acm.org/" target="_blank" title="Learn more about the conference">CHI 2013</a> in Paris), and further funding for graduate studies.</p>
