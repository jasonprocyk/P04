						<h2 class="story overview">Design</h2>
						<p>
							The brief for this project asked us to design technology for developing nations but to deploy it in North America with the aim of inspiring critical reflection in the users.
						</p>
						<p>
							We designed a low-tech, modular blackboard system for classroom use in developing nations. The design specifies interlocking blackboard tiles that form a large, communal classsized writing surface when connected. When separated, each tile provides a smaller writing surface for individual students. Each student can take a tile home overnight, which encourages a sense of ownership that may provide motivation to return to and participate in the school.

						<h2 class="story">Implementation</h2>
						<p>
							We built the medium fidelity prototype using simple materials (wood, particle board, blackboard spray, dowels, chains, screws) and hand tools. It is fully functional. Each tile consists of two rectangular boards joined by two small chains so that the board can fold for easy transportation. The interior of the tile is surfaced with particle board that has been coated with a blackboard spray that enables both writing with chalk and erasing. When a tile is unfolded, the two halves lock together using an internal dowel joint. Separate tiles can be joined together to form larger boards using similar dowel joints on the exterior edges of the boards.
						</p>

						<h2 class="story">Evaluation</h2>
						<p>
							We identified a family with multiple small children as an ideal target for deployment, but within the time constraints of the study, we were unable to find suitable volunteers. Alternatively, we were able to deploy the design with a student teacher who regularly worked with young children in a classroom setting.
						</p>
						<p>
							Throughout the deployment period, we collected qualitative data through interviews and diary entries. The initial structured interview probed the user on his existing practices around classroom materials. At the end of the study, we conducted a more open-ended semi-structured interview in which we prompted the user to walk us through specific experiences he had with the device (e.g. can you walk us through the most memorable time you used the design?)
